//! # Succinct data structures in Rust
//!
//! Jerky is a collection of [succinct data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinct_data_structure),
//! powerful tools to store a variety of data structures in compressed space and
//! quickly perform operations on the compressed data.
//!
//! ## Design policy
//!
//! Thus far, many succinct data structures and their implementation techniques have been developed
//! for a wide range of applications.
//! To handle them in a single crate, we set up several design policies:
//!
//! - **Maintain interface consistency:**
//!   Jerky will adhere to a unified interface, facilitating the integration and replacement of data structures.
//!
//! - **Preserve identity:**
//!   Rather than offering every possible succinct data structure,
//!   Jerky will focus on providing only those that hold a competitive advantage over others.
//!
//! - **Ensure safety:**
//!   To avoid potential risks, Jerky will refrain from using unsafe instructions
//!   typically reserved for extremely low-level programming.
//!
//! - **Remain Rust-centric:**
//!   Jerky will consistently utilize Pure Rust in its implementation.
//!
//! ## Data structures
//!
//! The data structures provided in this crate are categorized as follows:
//!
//! - [Integer vectors](crate::int_vectors)
//! - [Bit vectors](crate::bit_vector)
//! - [Character sequences](crate::char_sequences)
//!
//! The descriptions for each category are available in the corresponding module.
//!
//! Throughout this document, we write $`\log_2`$ with $`\lg`$.
//!
//! ## Serialization
//!
//! The previous copying based serialization infrastructure has been removed and
//! will be replaced with zeroâ€‘copy utilities in the future.
//!
//! ## Limitation
//!
//! This library is designed to run on 64-bit machines.
